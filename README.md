# Arduino-Radar

This project is a simple arudion radar which measures the degree position of the sensor and it's distance from objects when you press the on button. When activated it continually prints the information to the serial monitor. When the servo reaches 180 degrees it then reverses itself back to 0 degrees while continually sensing the surroundings. When it reaches 0 degrees it turns itself off and it can be reactivated by pressing the on button again.
